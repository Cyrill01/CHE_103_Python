    "## Exercise 1: Nesting and Linear Algebra\n",
    "In computer science, nesting refers to data that is organized in a layered manner. In Python, we can typically encounter nesting when elements of a list (or a dictionary) are themselves lists (or dictionaries). This is very useful to create and keep complex data in a clear and organized fashion. Below is an example of nested dictionary describing a triangle and its properties:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# triangle properties as a dictionary\n",
    "triangle = {}\n",
    "triangle[\"type\"] = \"right\"  # one 90 deg angle\n",
    "# the values associated to the keys \"sides\" and \"angles\" are dictionary themselves\n",
    "triangle[\"sides\"] = {\"a\":3.0, \"b\":4.0, \"c\":5.0, \"units\":\"cm\"} \n",
    "triangle[\"angles\"] = {\"alpha\":0.6435, \"beta\":0.9273, \"gamma\":1.5708, \"units\":\"radians\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(triangle[\"angles\"][\"beta\"]) # 0.9273 is printed\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the values associated to the `\"sides\"` and `\"angles\"` keys are themselves dictionaries, which makes the querry for any information very straight forward. It is then very clear that `triangle[\"angles\"][\"beta\"]` is the angle $\\beta$ of our triangle, and that it is measured in `triangle[\"angles\"][\"units\"]`. In principle, there is no limit to how many layers a nested structure can have and list and dictionaries can be happily mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear algebra, it is possible to store a matrix as nested lists. For example, the matrix $\\  \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9\\end{pmatrix} $ can be saved in Python as:\n",

    "In computational science, it is very common to solve problems using converging algorithms. This usually happens when the solution cannot be obtained directly, but an iterative set of operations yields increasingly better approximations.
