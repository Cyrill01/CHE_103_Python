    "## Exercise 1: The String Object\n",
    "As you have seen during the lecture, Python is a so-called object-oriented programming language. It is categorized like this because it enables the creation of objects, which are collections of data and/or methods. The data stored in objects are usually called attributes, and methods are simply pre-defined lists of actions that can be executed on demand. Actually, all of the types (int, float, str, ...) that you have seen so far in the lecture are objects. In this exercise, we will focus on strings and their methods. The methods are called with the help of a `.` (dot), as in the example below:"
