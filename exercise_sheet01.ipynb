For the CPU to work as intended, it must know the common type of the provided variables in order to choose the correct operation (*e.g.* integer addition, float multiplication, etc.).

However, Pyhton is smart and it allows for mixed type operations (*i.e.* Python automatically performs type conversion before the operation), as long as they are deemed safe.
